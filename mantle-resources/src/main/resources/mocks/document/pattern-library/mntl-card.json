At its lowest point, the village has an elevation of 11,386 feet/ 3,440 meters, making this the worldâ€™s highest Irish pub. Popular with those looking to acclimatize to high altitude before attempting an Everest climb, the pub is adorned with international flags and a sign that reads â€œThere are no strangers here, only friends that havenâ€™t metâ€. This sentiment is apt, as the pub is well-known for its mountaineering camaraderie. Opt for a pint of Guinness by the fireplace, or for traditional Sherpa beverages including the millet-based alcohol â€‹<em>tongba</em>. From the bar stock to the pool table, everything in the bar arrived there via yak train or on the backs of Nepalese porters. </p>",

Today, Ulaanbaatar is a bustling metropolis whose population accounts for nearly half of the people in Mongolia. The success of the Dublin Irish Pub has seen an influx of Irish watering holes â€” so much so that the capitalâ€™s nightlife scene is dominated by Gaelic pubs. The original remains one of the best and most authentic, however, although purists will likely claim that the atmosphere is still a long way from that of a real Dublin boozer. Nevertheless, Dublin Irish Pub offers televised sport and cold pints of Guinness, accompanied by good European music. If you fancy making a night of it, youâ€™ll find sprawling Grandkhaan Irish Pub on the same street. </p>",

In 2003, the pubâ€™s owner Nigel Sutton purchased the furniture from a condemned pub in Drogheda, County Louth and shipped the pieces (including the front door and the bar itself) to Africa. A born-and-bred Irishman, Sutton keeps the spirit of the Emerald Isle alive in his Kampala pub, with pub food favorites served alongside ubiquitous pints of Guinness at tables in the social beer garden. </p>",

The bar serves iconic Irish beers from brands like Caffreyâ€™s and Bulmers, while kitchen specialties include Irish steak and traditional fish and chips.
